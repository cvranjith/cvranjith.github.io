## **Introduction**  
Thereâ€™s a common misconception that moving from VMs to containers **automatically reduces resource requirements**. Some also assume that **microservices** are inherently small, leading to unrealistic expectations about infrastructure sizing.  

However, **containerization is not about reducing resource usageâ€”itâ€™s about flexibility, automation, cloud adoption, and efficient resource utilization**. Similarly, **"micro" in microservices refers to modularity, not minimal resource footprint**. Letâ€™s clear up these misunderstandings using a simple **house metaphor** and discuss how to approach sizing effectively.

## **Misconception 1: "Deploying to Containers Means Smaller Sizing"**  

Imagine you have a house representing an application running on a **Virtual Machine (VM)**. Now, you move that house into a **containerized environment**. Does the house suddenly shrink? **No!** The number of people inside the house remains the same, and they still need the same space, resources, and utilities.


ðŸ“Œ **Key takeaway:** If an app requires **X amount of resources on a VM, it will still require X on a container**. **Containerization does not magically reduce CPU, RAM, or storage needs.** The **workload defines the resource needs, not the deployment model**.  

ðŸ”¹ **What does containerization offer instead?**  
- **Portability** â€“ Move workloads seamlessly across environments, whether on-premises or cloud.  
- **Automation** â€“ Deploy, scale, and manage applications efficiently with orchestration tools like Kubernetes.  
- **Cloud-native benefits** â€“ Leverage cloud elasticity, managed services, and optimized cost strategies.  
- **Faster deployments & updates** â€“ Containers simplify CI/CD pipelines, reducing downtime and increasing agility.  
- **Resource efficiency** â€“ While containerization doesnâ€™t shrink app needs, it allows for better **resource pooling and dynamic scaling**.  

ðŸš€ **What can be optimized?** While the base resource need remains the same, **autoscaling, workload profiling, and optimized instance selection** can help manage infrastructure costs over time. Instead of focusing on reducing size, teams should focus on **better resource utilization** using Kubernetes features like Horizontal Pod Autoscaler (HPA) and Cluster Autoscaler.

## **Misconception 2: "Microservices Means Tiny Apps"**  

The word **"micro" in microservices refers to modularity, not size**. A microservice is **independent**, meaning it needs its **own resources, runtime, and supporting components**.  

Using the house metaphor again, consider two approaches when moving from VMs to containers:  
1. **Keeping the entire house as-is inside a container** â†’ This is similar to running a **monolithic** application in a container, where all functionalities remain tightly coupled.  
2. **Breaking the house into smaller units** â†’ This is the **microservices approach**. Each smaller house (service) is independent, meaning it needs **its own kitchen, bathrooms, and utilities**. While this approach enables better scalability and flexibility, it also **adds overhead** because each unit must function autonomously.  

ðŸ“Œ **Key takeaway:** Microservices are not necessarily "tiny." While they **offer flexibility, independent scaling, and fault isolation**, each service **adds weight** to the overall system. A service that seems small in terms of functionality may still have a **significant runtime footprint** due to dependencies, API communication, and state management needs.  

ðŸš€ **Additional Considerations:**  
- **Operational Complexity** â€“ Managing many independent services increases deployment, monitoring, and troubleshooting efforts.  
- **Communication Overhead** â€“ Unlike monoliths, microservices need inter-service communication, often adding latency and requiring API gateways.  
- **Infrastructure Cost** â€“ Each service has its own **resource allocation, logging, and security configurations**, which can lead to higher cumulative costs if not managed well.

## **So, How Should We Think About Sizing?**  

1. **Base sizing is determined by workload needs, not just deployment type.**  
   - The infrastructure footprint is based on **peak loads, concurrency requirements, and projected usage patterns**.  
2. **Can we start small? Yes!**  
   - Autoscalers can help adjust resource allocation dynamically to match demand.  
   - Example: **Increase teller service pods during the day when traffic is high, then repurpose resources for batch processing at night**.  
3. **Microservices introduce overhead but enable flexibility.**  
   - Not all applications benefit from microservicesâ€”monoliths are still valid for certain workloads.  
   - The **minimum footprint is higher because each service requires its own dependencies, networking, and scaling logic**.  

âœ… **Best Practice:** Instead of focusing solely on microservices or containers, teams should take a **hybrid approach**, carefully evaluating **what should be split into microservices and what should remain together** to balance flexibility with efficiency.

## **Final Thoughts**  

Understanding **what containerization and microservices truly offer** helps in setting **the right expectations**. Moving to containers **does not** automatically shrink application resource needs, and microservices **are not inherently lightweight**â€”they offer **different advantages** that must be balanced with architectural considerations.
