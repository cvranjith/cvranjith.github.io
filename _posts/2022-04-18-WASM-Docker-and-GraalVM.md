## WASM

WebAssembly (WASM) is a binary instruction format for a stack-based virtual machine that is designed to be fast to decode and execute. It is a low-level, portable, binary format that is designed to be fast to decode and execute. It is an open standard that is supported by all major web browsers, including Chrome, Firefox, and Safari.

## Docker

Docker is a platform for developing, shipping, and running applications in containers. It allows developers to package an application with all of its dependencies and run it in a variety of environments, including on different operating systems and in different cloud environments.

## GraalVM 

GraalVM is a high-performance virtual machine for running Java applications. It is designed to improve the performance of Java applications by using advanced techniques, such as ahead-of-time (AOT) compilation, to optimize the performance of the Java Virtual Machine (JVM).

One of the key features of WASM is its ability to run on both the web and in standalone environments. This makes it a great fit for use in conjunction with Docker and GraalVM. By using WASM in a Docker container, developers can package their applications with all of their dependencies and run them in a variety of environments, including on different operating systems and in different cloud environments. And by using GraalVM, developers can improve the performance of their WASM applications.

To use WASM in Docker, developers can use a base image that includes a WASM runtime, such as Wasmer. They can then package their WASM application and its dependencies in a Docker container and deploy it to a variety of environments. This allows for easy deployment and management of WASM applications, as well as the ability to run them in a variety of environments.

To use WASM with GraalVM, developers can use the GraalVM WASM interpreter to run their WASM applications. The GraalVM WASM interpreter is a high-performance, open-source WASM interpreter that is designed to improve the performance of WASM applications by using advanced techniques, such as ahead-of-time (AOT) compilation. This allows developers to take advantage of the performance benefits of GraalVM while still being able to use WASM as the underlying binary format for their applications.

By combining the power of WASM, Docker, and GraalVM, developers can create high-performance, portable applications that can run in a variety of environments. WASM allows for fast decoding and execution of binary code, while Docker enables easy deployment and management of applications. And by using GraalVM, developers can take advantage of advanced performance optimization techniques to improve the overall performance of their applications.

It is worth mentioning that the combination of WebAssembly, GraalVM and Docker opens the possibility of running a Java based application as WebAssembly. This can be achieved through GraalWasm which is a experimental project from Oracle, GraalWasm is a native image generator for WebAssembly, to take full advantage of WebAssemblyâ€™s capabilities, it can be used inside a container.

Overall, WASM is a powerful technology that has the potential to revolutionize how we build and deploy applications. When used in conjunction with technologies like Docker and GraalVM, it can enable the creation of high-performance, portable applications that can run in a variety of environments. With the continued growth and adoption of WASM, we can expect to see more and more applications built on this technology in the future
