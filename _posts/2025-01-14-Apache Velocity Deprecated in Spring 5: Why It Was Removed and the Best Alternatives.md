## Introduction

Spring Framework has been evolving consistently, adapting to modern development needs and best practices. One significant change was the deprecation and eventual removal of Apache Velocity support. This article explores why Velocity was deprecated in Spring 4.3 and removed in Spring 5.0, along with the best alternatives developers can use for templating in Spring applications.

## Why Was Apache Velocity Deprecated and Removed?

### Deprecated in Spring 4.3
Velocity was officially deprecated in Spring 4.3 due to multiple reasons:
- **Lack of Active Development:** Apache Velocity had seen minimal updates since 2010, raising concerns about security and maintainability.
- **Shift in Template Engine Preferences:** Modern template engines like Thymeleaf and FreeMarker had become more popular, offering better integration and performance.
- **Spring's Decision to Reduce Third-Party Dependencies:** The Spring team aimed to streamline support for actively maintained technologies.

### Removed in Spring 5.0
With the release of Spring 5.0, Velocity support was entirely removed. The official release notes and discussions confirm this decision:
- [Spring Framework Issue #18368](https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-framework/issues/18368) highlights the deprecation.
- [Spring Framework 5.0 Release Notes](https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-framework/wiki/Spring-Framework-5.0-Release-Notes) document its removal.

Developers relying on Velocity had to migrate to other templating solutions.

## The Best Alternatives to Apache Velocity

### 1. **Thymeleaf** - The Modern Standard
[Thymeleaf](https://www.thymeleaf.org/) is a powerful, flexible Java template engine designed for seamless integration with Spring Boot.
- **HTML5-compliant templates**: Works as static HTML, making development and debugging easier.
- **Rich feature set**: Supports conditional statements, loops, and Spring expression language (SpEL).
- **Easy integration**: Well-supported in Spring Boot via `spring-boot-starter-thymeleaf`.

### 2. **FreeMarker** - Feature-Rich and Versatile
[FreeMarker](https://freemarker.apache.org/) is a widely used template engine that offers great flexibility.
- **Customizable syntax**: Works well for generating HTML, emails, configuration files, and more.
- **Strong integration**: Spring Boot provides built-in support via `spring-boot-starter-freemarker`.
- **Good documentation**: Well-maintained with extensive examples.

### 3. **Groovy Templates** - Dynamic and Expressive
[Groovy Templates](http://groovy-lang.org/) are a great option for developers familiar with Groovy.
- **Dynamic scripting**: Supports inline scripting with Groovy expressions.
- **Flexible syntax**: Easier for those already using Groovy in their projects.
- **Spring integration**: Supported out of the box with Spring Boot.

### 4. **Mustache** - Lightweight and Logic-Less
[Mustache](https://mustache.github.io/) is a minimalistic template engine that enforces a separation between logic and presentation.
- **Logic-less templates**: No embedded Java code, promoting clean MVC architecture.
- **Fast and lightweight**: Ideal for microservices and small projects.
- **Supported in Spring Boot**: Included via `spring-boot-starter-mustache`.

### 5. **Pebble** - High Performance with Twig-Like Syntax
[Pebble](https://pebbletemplates.io/) is inspired by Twig (from PHP) and offers a clean and fast templating approach.
- **Template inheritance**: Helps in structuring large applications.
- **Auto-escaping**: Improves security by preventing XSS attacks.
- **Spring Boot support**: Available via `spring-boot-starter-pebble`.

## Conclusion
Apache Velocity's deprecation and removal from Spring was a necessary step to keep the framework modern and secure. Developers migrating from Velocity have several strong alternatives, each offering unique advantages. Depending on your project needs, Thymeleaf, FreeMarker, Groovy Templates, Mustache, or Pebble can serve as excellent replacements.
