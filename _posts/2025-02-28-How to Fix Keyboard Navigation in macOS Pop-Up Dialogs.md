If you've ever tried to use your keyboard to navigate a pop-up dialog in macOS—such as when closing a document and being prompted to **Save, Don't Save, or Cancel**—you might have noticed that sometimes, **Tab** doesn't cycle through the buttons as expected. Even if you have **"Use keyboard navigation to move focus between controls"** enabled in **System Settings**, the problem can persist. 

After searching for solutions and troubleshooting extensively, I discovered a simple but effective fix that isn't widely documented. If you're facing this issue, try the following method:

## **The Quick Fix: Toggle Full Keyboard Access**
1. Open **System Settings** (or **System Preferences** in older macOS versions).
2. Go to **Keyboard** → **Keyboard Shortcuts**.
3. Select **Keyboard** on the left panel.
4. Locate **"Use keyboard navigation to move focus between controls"** and toggle it **off**.
5. Wait a few seconds, then toggle it **on** again.

This reset seems to refresh macOS's ability to recognize keyboard focus within pop-up dialogs. Once enabled, you should be able to navigate the buttons using the **Tab** key as expected.

## **Alternative Methods to Navigate Dialogs**
If the issue persists, try these additional keyboard shortcuts:

- **`Return` or `Enter`** – Selects the default button (usually "Save").
- **`Esc`** – Acts as "Cancel".
- **`Command + Delete`** – Chooses "Don't Save" in file dialogs.
- **`fn + Tab`** – Sometimes required for button focus in certain macOS versions.
- **`Control + Tab` or `Option + Tab`** – Alternative navigation in some apps.
- **`Command + Left/Right Arrow`** – Moves focus between buttons in some cases.
