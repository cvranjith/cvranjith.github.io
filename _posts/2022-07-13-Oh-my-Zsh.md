If you are using Linux or Mac OS X, Oh-My-Zsh is a great tool to manager your ZSH shell


This article provides basic configuration steps for zsh and oh-my-zh configuration


    Install ZSH
        Check if zsh is installed


        which zsh


            if the output is like below then proceed to install


            which: no zsh in (/usr/local/bin:/usr/bin:/usr/local/sbin:/usr/sbin)
            If zsh is not installed, you can install by yum install zsh
            $ sudo yum install zsh -y

            Sample output
             Collapse source
            Failed to set locale, defaulting to C
            Loaded plugins: langpacks, ulninfo

            Complete!
            Now zsh should be available


            $ which zsh
            /usr/bin/zsh
    Install oh-my-zsh


    wget https://github.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh/raw/master/tools/install.sh -O - | zsh
    cp ~/.oh-my-zsh/templates/zshrc.zsh-template ~/.zshrc
    source ~/.zshrc
    Customize zsh Theme
        Following are some my favorite themes  (Powerlevel10k or agnoster).
            powerlevel10k - Follow https://github.com/romkatv/powerlevel10k#oh-my-zsh


            git clone --depth=1 https://github.com/romkatv/powerlevel10k.git ${ZSH_CUSTOM:-$HOME/.oh-my-zsh/custom}/themes/powerlevel10k


            Edit ZSH_TEHEME (edit ~/.zshrc  → entry ZSH_THEM)
            #ZSH_THEME="robbyrussell"
            ZSH_THEME="powerlevel10k/powerlevel10k"
             "agnoster' by editing ~/.zshrc  → entry ZSH_THEME


            #ZSH_THEME="robbyrussell"
            ZSH_THEME="agnoster"
    Install / configure plugins 
        Auto-complete is a useful plugin.


        git clone https://github.com/zsh-users/zsh-autosuggestions ${ZSH_CUSTOM:-~/.oh-my-zsh/custom}/plugins/zsh-autosuggestions

        edit ~/.zshrc  → entry plugins → add "zsh-autosuggestions". Also you may use other useful plugins such as docker / docker-compose 
        plugins=(git docker docker-compose zsh-autosuggestions)
        set -o vi
    Fuzzy Finder (fzf) (https://github.com/junegunn/fzf#using-git)
        git clone --depth 1 https://github.com/junegunn/fzf.git ~/.fzf
        ~/.fzf/install

    If you want to disable auto update, please add this entry to the beginning of .zshrc file. Else zsh will try to automatically lookup for updates every time when the shell is initiated.
        DISABLE_AUTO_UPDATE="true"


To upgrade zsh to 5.8: https://github.com/romkatv/zsh-bin
