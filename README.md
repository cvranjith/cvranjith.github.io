Welcome to my blog! My name is Ranjith and I am a solution architect at Oracle with over 23 years of experience in the industry especially in Oracle environments and specialize in cloud native technologies such as Microservice Architecture, Cloud technologies, DevOps, and Infrastructure as Code. My hands-on experience in container technologies, such as Docker and Kubernetes, along with proficiency in both AWS and Oracle Cloud Infrastructure platforms, allows me to share insights and knowledge on these topics through my writing.

In my free time, I enjoy speed-cubing, running and pursuing photography. 

The views and opinions expressed on this blog are solely my own and do not represent those of my company. I hope you find my posts informative and insightful. Thanks for visiting!
