Welcome to my blog!

My name is Ranjith and I am a solution architect at Oracle with over 23 years of experience in the IT industry in Banking and Finance Domain. I have worked extensively in Oracle Database and Middleware Technologies. In the recent years I focus on cloud native technologies such as Microservice Architecture, Cloud Computing, DevOps, and Infrastructure as Code. My hands-on experience in Oracle Technologies as well as Container technologies, such as Docker and Kubernetes, along with proficiency in both AWS and Oracle Cloud Infrastructure platforms, allows me to share insights and knowledge on these topics through my writing.

In my free time, I enjoy speed-cubing, running and pursuing photography. 

A random fact about me :

My favorite part of my body is my fingers, which I believe are fast and agile. I consider them to be my greatest asset, as they play a big role in many of my talents and interests. My fingers allow me to type quickly (sometimes I type code faster than my brain), speed-sollving Rubik's cubes, perform magic tricks (mostly with Rubik's cubes), create art through sketching, drawing, and painting, and play the South Indian percussion instrument, Mridangam. I love my fingers!
